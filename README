DESCRIPTION
    Implements a minimalistic change management process within RT.

    It is often the case that businesses that have achieved some level of
    ISO or SOC compliance must have a standardized process by which to
    handle changes to software, hardware, infrastructure, etc. This
    extension implements a minimal change management system within RT. It
    provides a framework for handling a variety of change types, and leaves
    a lot of room for growth and flexibility with regards to your
    organization's practices and procedures.

    When combined with RT::Extension::MandatoryOnTransition, this extension
    can transform into a fully-featured change management system.

  Change Management Queue
    After installing, you'll see a new queue called "Change Management" for
    tracking all of the incoming change requests. You can change the name to
    anything you like after installing. In a typical configuration, you will
    also want to assign an RT email address, like changes@example.com or
    crb@example.com (Change Review Board) to create tickets in this queue.

  Custom Roles
