DESCRIPTION
    This extension provides the configuration to implement a change
    management process in Request Tracker
    <https://bestpractical.com/request-tracker>.

    Organizations working to standardize internal processes for ISO or SOC
    compliance must have a standardized way to deploy and track changes to
    software, hardware, infrastructure, etc. This extension implements a
    change management system within RT, providing a framework for handling a
    variety of change types. It uses all core RT features, so everything can
    be modified as needed to align with your organization's practices and
    procedures. As-is, it provides a simple, fully functional implementation
    of an ITIL-like change management process.

    To provide additional validation and required fields for different
    stages of the process, you can install
    RT::Extension::MandatoryOnTransition. An example configuration is
    provided in the sample configuration file in
    etc/ChangeManagement_Config.pm.

    We've provided a walkthrough video <https://youtu.be/uQEEf7SGlkg> to
    demonstrate some of the functionality available in the change management
    extension.

  Change Management Queue
    After installing, you'll see a new queue called Change Management for
    tracking all of the incoming change requests. You can change the name to
    anything you like after installing. In a typical configuration, you will
    also want to assign an RT email address, like *changes@example.com* or
    *crb@example.com* (Change Review Team) to create tickets in this queue.

   Rights
    By default, Everyone can see the queue, create tickets, and view
    tickets. All users can also set custom fields on create, but only then.
    You can grant more rights if your change requestors need to update
    custom fields after the ticket is created.

    The Change Management group has more rights to work on change tickets
    including taking ownership and approving or rejecting requests.

    Some custom rights are available if you go to Admin > Queues, click on
    Change Management, then click Group Rights. The "Status changes" tab has
    specific rights to allow users to "Approve Requests" and "Implement
    Changes". By default, the Change Reviewer role can "Approve Requests"
    and the Change Implementor role can "Implement Changes". If this is too
    restrictive for your workflow, you can grant these to more users,
    possibly via a group.

  Custom Roles
    The roles below are allow you to assign different users to parts of the
    change management process. In addition to clearly identifying who is
    responsible for parts of the process, these roles can be used to manage
    rights and notifications like email.

    Change Reviewer
        Person who reviews incoming change requests, and is responsible for
        approving or denying a change request.

    Change Implementor
        Person who is responsible for implementing a change request.

  Groups
    Groups are included to make it easy to add users quickly and give them
    sufficient rights to interact with the Change Management queue.

    The Change Management group gives a set of rights appropriate for staff
    who will work with chagne management tickets. It allows them to take
    tickets, comment, change custom fields, etc. You can refine all of these
    after you install the extension.

  Change Management Lifecycle
    The Change Management lifecycle provides a set of common statuses. You
    can update this as needed to add or remove statuses and transitions.

    Requested
        Status given to a new change request. Indicates than a change has
        been requested and is awaiting approval.

    Approved
        For changes that are approved but not yet implemented.

    In Progress
        An approved change that is in the process of being deployed.

    Partially Deployed
        The change has been partially deployed; it is either taking an
        unusually long time to complete, or part of the deployment succeeded
        while another part failed. Reasons as to why should be detailed in a
        comment.

    Deployed
        The change has been deployed successfully.

    Failed
        The change failed to deploy. Reasons should be detailed in a
        comment.

    Cancelled
        This change was cancelled. Reasoning should be provided in a
        comment.

    Rejected
        The change was rejected by the review team. Reasoning should be
        provided in a comment on the ticket.

  Custom Fields
    Some common custom fields are provided to track additional information
    about changes. The provided custom fields can be modified as needed, to
    add or remove available values in dropdowns, for example.

    You can also add more custom fields as needed. A %CustomFieldGroupings
    configuration is provided to group custom fields in a Change Management
    portlet. You can add new custom fields to this configuration to include
    them in this section.

   Change Category
    Specifies the kind of change that is to be performed.

   Change Type
    One of the three types of changes. The initial values are those outlined
    in ITIL:

    Standard
        A low risk, pre-authorized change that follows a repeatable process.
        This is the default for new tickets in the Change Management queue.

    Emergency
        A change that must be performed ASAP, potentially bypassing approval
        steps.

    Normal
        Any change that doesn't fall into the other types.

   Rollback Plan
    A description of the steps necessary to perform a rollback of the
    proposed changes in the event that the deployment process is
    unsuccessful.

   Change Started
    Date that the change was started. This is not the same as the normal
    Started date on the ticket. Started is set when the ticket is moved to
    an open status (such as approved); Change Started is when someone
    actually started implementing the change.

    A scrip is provided to automatically set this when status changes to in
    progress or partially deployed.

   Change Complete
    Date that the change was successfully deployed. A scrip is provided to
    automatically set this when status changes to deployed.

  Change Management Dashboard
    A Change Management dashboard is installed with two saved searches
    included, one for upcoming changes and one for recently completed
    changes. These are useful for tracking change tickets and are also good
    examples of the types of saved searches and dashboards you can create
    for different participants in the change process.

CUSTOMIZING AND EXTENDING
    Since this extension uses core RT features, it's easy for an RT
    administrator to customize various parts. Below are some ideas.

  Additional Custom Fields
    Some ideas of fields that could be added to the change management
    process might include:

    Change Origin
        Customer, Vendor, Internal. Dropdown.

    Location
        Datacenter, customer site, etc. Text.

    Implementation Steps
        Steps needed to implement proposed change. Text.

    Validation Steps
        Process for validating a change was deployed successfully. Text.

    Impact Assessment
        A description of what potential side effects of a proposed change
        might be, what could happen if the change goes awry, etc. Text.

   Making Custom Fields Required
    Using RT::Extension::MandatoryOnTransition, any of the above fields can
    be made required upon a status change. For example, you may wish to make
    Implementation Steps, Validation Steps, and Impact Assessment required
    fields before a change request can be approved. See
    etc/ChangeManagement_Config.pm for a ready-to-use example with the out
    of the box configuration.

   Default Values for Custom Fields
    As an RT admin, you can go to Admin > Queues > Change Management, then
    click on Default Values in the submenu. From that page, you can set or
    change the default values for assigned custom fields.
